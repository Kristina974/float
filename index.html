					<p>The iPhone 5C lacks several major new features introduced in the iPhone 5S; the 5C uses the A6 chip instead of the A7 with motion co-processor, does not include Touch ID, does not support OpenGL ES 3.0, and lacked the Burst iSight camera mode and slow-motion video recording mode. Instead, the iPhone 5C uses much of the same internal hardware of its predecessor, the iPhone 5. However the iPhone 5C uses a hard-coated polycarbonate casing (eschewing the aluminum used by the iPhone 5), along with a standard black glass front (instead of a white glass front offered on silver and gold iPhone models). Similar to the fifth generation iPod Touch models, the iPhone 5C was available in five colors: blue, green, pink, yellow, and white. It was also the first Apple device to ship with iOS 7, which introduced a revamped visual appearance and other new features. It is also the last iPhone to include the familiar "squircle" icon on the Home button.</p>
